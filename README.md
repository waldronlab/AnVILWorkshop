## Workshop Description

The rapidly growing size of genomic datasets introduces 
challenges of data transfer, storage, access, sharing, and computing. In this workshop, 
we introduce cloud-based genomics platform [Terra](https://anvil.terra.bio/) 
as a potential solution. Terra hosts large-scale genomic and genomic-related data 
sets and provide secure remote access to them and to individually uploaded data resources. Terra
also provides on-demand computational capacity through Google Cloud Platform, and 
interactive analysis interfaces such as Jupyter notebook and RStudio. Users can 
run best practice tools and pipelines already implemented or upload their own
data or analysis methods to workspaces. Workshop participants will learn how to
use Terra through the use-case examples, instructor-led live demonstration, and the 
Bioconductor AnVIL package. 

This workshop is supported by the [NHGRI Genomic Data Science Analysis, Visualization and Informatics Lab-space (AnVIL)](https://anvilproject.org/)
