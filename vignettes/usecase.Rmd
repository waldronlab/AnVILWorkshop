# Terra for paper
### Introduction
[This workspace](https://app.terra.bio/#workspaces/waldronlab-terra/Tumor_Only_CNV) provides a fully reproducible example of copy number variation (CNV) and single nucleotide variants (SNV) analysis of tumor samples without matching normal profile, described in the recent publication [[link](https://ascopubs.org/doi/10.1200/CCI.19.00130)].    

**Reliable analysis of clinical tumor-only whole exome sequencing data**       
Oh *et al.*, JCO Clin Cancer Inform. 2020 Apr;4:321-335. doi: 10.1200/CCI.19.00130.   

### Benefits
The major benefits of having Terra workspace with research paper are:   
1) Data storage, pipeline (compute-intense), and downstream analysis are all available in one place   
2) Improved reproducibility   
3) Sharing code and providing additional information not included in the paper are available through the workspace   


### Features
**1. Data**   
- Paper used TCGA controlled data (BAM files) → Synthetic dataset for public workspace   
- Public reference files (stored in GCP, some are directly available through Terra)   
- Researcher’s own data (BED, COSMIC VCFs stored in GCP) → some available with ‘Requester pays’   

**2. Workflows**   
Left side of the diagram summarizes the CNV/SNV analysis workflow this paper used. 
Pink boxes around each segment of the pipeline are built into 7 WDL workflows in 
Terra, based on their modulatiry, input/output requirements. The numbered prefix
represents the order each workflows should run. For example, `1_MuTect1_PON`, 
`1_MuTect1_Variants_Calling`, and `1_PureCN_IntervalFile` can run all at the same
time because they don't have any dependence on other workflows for their inputs.

These workflows incorporate many different runtime environments (e.g. GATK, MuTect, 
Bioconductor,...).

**3. Notebooks**   
- 5 Jupyter notebooks using R → 4 for data pre-processing and 1 for downstream analysis   
- AnVIL package enables a direct connection between ‘Data’ and ‘Notebooks’

# Terra in the classroom 
Find out how to use Terra/AnVIL for teaching R/Bioconductor [**HERE**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fNNn3kleLrZLiXHsaUz7z2Et3kZ-IpIcBTlYzCYmscI/edit#heading=h.vjjftpr63rnl)!

### Share Workspace
Terra workspace allows setup of a lecture or lab in advance of sharing it, where 
everyone uses the same runtime environment - no setup or compatibility issues. Also, 
creating runtime is very intuitive with the cost/hr information. 

**How to share:**   
1) Collect Google emails of all students (if institution is using GSuite, can be institutional emails)   
2) “Create a new group” at https://app.terra.bio/#groups (Note: group name must be (universally?) unique)   
3) Scroll down or type to find this group, and click   
4) Click “Add User” and enter email address. Repeat for each email address

**Benefits:**   
- Workspaces can be shared with group in one step   
- Read/write/own options   
- Can share compute resources on any particular workspace   
- Can remove or change permissions or group members at any time   
- Set permissions per workspace   



### Control Billing
**How to setup:**   
Need a [Google Cloud Platform billing account](https://console.cloud.google.com/)   
- Can use educational credits billing account   
- Can use [Onix billing account](https://www.onixnet.com/onspend-cloud-billing)   
- Can use regular billing account backed by credit card   

**Positives:**   
- Each student selects a compute environment with known cost per hour:    
each student can select what they need     
- Terra auto-suspend of notebook runtimes helped keep costs low     
- Students only have to login, don’t have to set up billing

**Negatives:**   
- Each student selects a compute environment with known cost per hour:      
No way to identify an over-spending student or to limit what runtime they must use   
- No cost breakdown per student

**Notes:**   
- Billing is post-pay (you can find out how much has been spent with ~24h delay)
